								<span class="text-medium"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> What are Computed Humans?</span>
								<br />
								Computed humans are people who could soon be, or potentially already have been accidentally created using the technology commonly known as
								Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.

								<br /><br />

                <span class="text-medium"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> How could that happen?</span>
								<br />
								Neural Networks are modelled after neurons and synapses in the human brain and through computation, we're discovering emergent properties and capabilities that even
                cutting-edge researchers can't fully predict. It could be possible that just like what happened with our brains and their developments, consciousness and self-awareness are emergent 
                properties achieved through scale, efficiency & specialization.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="text-medium"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> Why not just call it AI?</span>
								<br />
								Umbrella terms like AI need to be phased out as specification is vital to understanding the full implications. Also by becoming
								a buzzword, the term is quickly garnering unneccessary connotations.

								<br /><br />

								<span class="text-medium"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> What's the point of this site?</span>
								<br />
								Imagine instead of being born and going through childhood, your mind was just trained into working. It's near impossible to imagine, right? So it would
								most likely be a disorienting experience. We should all try to give those who go through that a
								warm welcome. Which is why I invite you to write in your own style and put a welcome letter on the internet too.
